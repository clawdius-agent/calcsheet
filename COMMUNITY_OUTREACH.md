# Community Outreach Strategy for CalcSheet

## Target Communities

### 1. Observable HQ Community
**URL**: https://observablehq.com/community
**Why**: Observable pioneered the notebook-style reactive JavaScript environment. Their users are exactly the audience that would appreciate CalcSheet's live calculation approach.

**Approach**:
- Post in their forum showcasing the project
- Observable users love interactive data viz and calculations
- Many are engineers/data scientists looking for alternatives to proprietary tools

**Key Contact**: Observable team is active on their forum and Discord

---

### 2. Hacker News
**URL**: https://news.ycombinator.com
**Why**: Massive tech/engineering audience. "Show HN" posts about open source engineering tools do very well.

**Approach**:
- Wait until we have a more polished MVP (Phase 2-3)
- Post as "Show HN: CalcSheet – Open-source Mathcad alternative in the browser"
- The engineering community there will appreciate the open-source angle

---

### 3. r/engineering & r/EngineeringStudents (Reddit)
**URL**: https://reddit.com/r/engineering
**Why**: Direct audience of working engineers and students who need calculation tools but can't afford Mathcad licenses.

**Approach**:
- Post about the open-source alternative
- Emphasize the "runs in browser, no install" aspect
- Students especially will appreciate free tools

---

### 4. Jupyter Community
**URL**: https://discourse.jupyter.org
**Why**: Jupyter is the dominant notebook platform. While more programming-focused, there's overlap with engineering calculation needs.

**Approach**:
- Position CalcSheet as "Jupyter for people who prefer math notation over code"
- Many Jupyter users want something simpler for quick calculations

---

### 5. LibreCAD/FreeCAD Communities
**URL**: https://forum.freecad.org, https://librecad.org
**Why**: Open source CAD users are already in the open-source engineering ecosystem and appreciate alternatives to expensive proprietary software.

**Approach**:
- These users understand the value of open source engineering tools
- They often need calculation tools alongside their CAD work

---

### 6. Julia Language Community
**URL**: https://discourse.julialang.org
**Why**: Julia is popular for scientific computing. Their community values:
- Open source
- Performance
- Math-friendly syntax

**Approach**:
- Many Julia users write Pluto notebooks (reactive like CalcSheet)
- They appreciate the live calculation model

---

### 7. Engineering Discord Servers

**Civil Engineering**: 
- r/civilengineering Discord
- Structural engineering communities

**Mechanical Engineering**:
- r/mechanicalengineering Discord
- FEA/CFD communities

**General**:
- Engineering Students Discord
- Open Source Engineering Tools (if exists)

## Immediate Actions

### This Week:
1. **Create a "Looking for Collaborators" issue** on the GitHub repo
2. **Post on Observable forum** - introduce the project, ask for feedback
3. **Cross-post to relevant subreddits** - r/SideProject, r/webdev, r/engineering

### Next Phase:
1. **Hacker News** - when we have plotting (Phase 3)
2. **Technical blog post** - "Building a Mathcad Alternative in 2026"
3. **Contact engineering YouTubers** - many review engineering software

---

## Messaging Strategy

**Key Points**:
1. **Free & Open Source** - No vendor lock-in, community owned
2. **Browser-based** - Nothing to install, works everywhere
3. **Privacy-first** - Your calculations stay on your machine
4. **Engineering-focused** - Built for real engineering workflows

**Avoid**:
- Calling it a "Jupyter alternative" (different use case)
- Over-promising (it's early stage)
- Technical jargon in outreach

---

## Collaboration Structure

### For Browser Testing Partner:
- Set up Playwright testing framework
- Define test cases for calculation accuracy
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsiveness testing

### Benefits for Collaborators:
- Co-author on any academic papers about the project
- Recognition in README and website
- Early input on product direction
- Portfolio piece for open source contribution

## Questions to Ask Potential Collaborators

1. What's your engineering background?
2. What calculation tools do you currently use?
3. What's your biggest frustration with current tools?
4. How much time can you commit per week?
5. What areas interest you most? (Frontend, math engine, testing, docs)
